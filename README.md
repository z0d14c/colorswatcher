# Color Swatcher

Color Swatcher is an interactive playground for exploring how hue, saturation, and lightness affect the color names surfaced by the color data service that powers the experience. The interface streams color segments in real time as you experiment with different values, rearranging each swatch by hue so you can quickly scan for interesting combinations without interrupting the flow of new results.

Built with React Router, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, the project showcases modern data loading patterns including optimistic updates, streaming responses, and graceful error states. Use it as a reference implementation for building responsive color-driven experiences or as inspiration for integrating progressive enhancement techniques into your own applications.
